# Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone or download this repo

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 


# Running the Project
Run the development server with:
```npm run dev```
This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http: // localhost:3000 into the address bar.

'''ctrl  +  c ''' to stop


# Building the Project
Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
